Appended is anonymized data from the Course Experience Survey I ran
2001-2006 for CSE courses.

It contains responses to 12 questions for ~30000 enrollments by ~6000 students in ~700  offerings of ~130 courses.

You can give the data to specific students to work on:

a) I need to know who has the data.

b) They need to agree to not to redistribute the data in anyway and to be careful it is not publicly accessible.

c) They need to agree to remove the data when the work is done.

d) They need to agree to not to attempt to de-anonymize the students or course in any way.

I promised the students that their identity would be available only to me.  I've mapped student numbers & courses to consecutive integers.
But this, or stronger measures, are not enough to prevent the data being de-anonymized.

The columns are:

1) student number (mapped to consecutive integer)
2) session (e.g. 03s2)
3) course (mapped to consecutive integer)
4) student mark in course
5) student grade
6-19) responses to the 12 questions below

Respsonse on 5-point scale where 1 = Strongly disagree 5 = Strongly Disagree or NA for not answered.

q01 It was always easy to know the standard of work expected in %COURSE%.
q02 I developed important skills in %COURSE%.
q03 The teaching staff of %COURSE% motivated me to do my best work.
q04 The workload in %COURSE% was too heavy.
q05 I usually had a clear idea of where I was going and what was expected of me in %COURSE%
q06 In %COURSE% I was tested on what I had memorized more than what I understood.
q07 I received helpful feedback on my work during %COURSE%.
q08 The teaching staff worked hard to make %COURSE% interesting.
q09 The topics covered in %COURSE% are important.
q01 I was generally given enough time to understand the things I had to learn in %COURSE%.
q11 The assessment methods tested well what I'd learnt in %COURSE%.
q12 Overall, I was satisfied with the quality of %COURSE%.

Note q4 & q6 are "negatively phrased" - not my design - the survey deliberately copied an external survey for graduates.

If only 1 question is analysed - the summary question (q12) is the probably the most interesting.
